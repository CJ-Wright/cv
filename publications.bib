abstract = {We report selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide on gold nanoparticles (NPs) in 0.5 M KHCO3 at 25 °C. Among monodisperse 4, 6, 8, and 10 nm NPs tested, the 8 nm Au NPs show the maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) (up to 90\% at -0.67 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Density functional theory calculations suggest that more edge sites (active for CO evolution) than corner sites (active for the competitive H2 evolution reaction) on the Au NP surface facilitates the stabilization of the reduction intermediates, such as COOH*, and the formation of CO. This mechanism is further supported by the fact that Au NPs embedded in a matrix of butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate for more efficient COOH* stabilization exhibit even higher reaction activity (3 A/g mass activity) and selectivity (97\% FE) at -0.52 V (vs RHE). The work demonstrates the great potentials of using monodisperse Au NPs to optimize the available reaction intermediate binding sites for efficient and selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.},

@article{Wright2015,
abstract = {We report the activity and selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to carbon monoxide and formate on rutile (110) and anatase (101) TiO2. Our studies show that the rutile TiO2 phase was found to be more selective, with Faradaic efficiencies of \~{} 15\% and \~{} 18\% for CO and formate, while the anatase efficiencies were less than \~{}2\%.  The phase dependent efficiency exhibited by the electrochemical reaction is opposite to previously reported photochemical CO2 reduction efficiency, which showed a greater activity from anatase TiO2. In order to evaluate the role of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ sites in the catalytic activity XPS was performed on the catalysts after CO2 reduction. The XPS showed oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ defects in both the anatase and rutile phases. This implies that while the presence of surface defects may be necessary for the electro reduction of CO2 on TiO2 the efficiency determining property is the catalyst’s underlying atomic structure. Our recent results using DFT to elucidate a potential mechanism for this phenomenon, comparing the binding energies of CO2 reduction adsorbates on rutile and anatase TiO2, will also be discussed. },

abstract = {Single phase (Pr1-xNdx)2NiO4 powders (x=0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1) were synthesized via glycine-nitrate combustion process. Rietveld refinement shows that the unit cell volume decreases linearly with an increase of x. This volume contraction is mainly driven by a decrease in c parameter which follows Vegard’s Law. Reproducible performance was obtained for each cathode composition providing the wealth of data for quantitative studies. The overall cell performance decreases with an increase in Nd content between 650 and 850 °C, based on analysis of area specific resistance and i-E measurements. Performance stability was studied at 750 °C and 0.8 V. In comparison to the parent compound Pr2NiO4, the total polarization increases by 29\% in (Pr0.5Nd0.5)2NiO4 and by twofold in (Pr0.25Nd0.75)2NiO4. Although exhibiting the highest peak performance, Pr2NiO4-based cells show 4\% performance degradation within 500 hours, while the degradation is negligible in other compositions. Dynamic dependency of EIS spectra, as function of current density, is in agreement with dc measurements. },

@article{Dogdibegovic2016a,
abstract = {A new method to quantify the phase evolution in nickelates is developed using sintered metal grids as cathode current collectors. The metal grids not only enable us to carry out phase quantification studies in cathodes, but also retaining the cell’s performance and stability. Moreover, they are chemically compatible with the cathode and allow XRD analysis of the surface and bulk of the cathode after cell operation. Multiple cells were tested to study the reproducibility of measurements. High performance was observed in cells with metal grids, extending the application of this method to cathode durability studies in state-of-the-art SOFCs.  Respective advantages and challenges of the method are discussed with an emphasis on phase quantification, and the effects of different noble metals in cells regarding their thermal, electrical, chemical, and mechanical stability. Au was found to be the most suitable current collector due to its low chemical reactivity with the cathode and mechanical compatibility at operating conditions. },
